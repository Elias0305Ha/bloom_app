## Overview
Bloom is a modern Flutter app for mood tracking, activity logging, habit formation, and weekly reflection. It blends a delightful user experience with practical habit science and actionable insights, backed by MongoDB Atlas for reliable cloud persistence.

## Key Features
- Mood logging with intensity, activities, triggers, and notes
- Dynamic mood theming and celebratory streaks
- Smart suggestions and greetings based on context
- Daily Hub: Today‚Äôs overview, focus/todos, evening review, insights
- Habit Tracker with completions, streaks, stats, and suggestions
- Weekly Review with improved week navigation and charts
- Timeline redesigned as a grouped, vertical timeline with filters
- Local notifications with a daily reminder toggle and time picker
- MongoDB Atlas persistence via `mongo_dart`

## Screens
- Home: gradient UI, smart dashboard, quick mood, detailed form, quick-log FAB
- Daily Hub: intelligent overview, progress ring, stats, todos, evening review
- Timeline: grouped-by-day vertical timeline with mood filters and details
- Weekly Review: week selector, summaries, and charts
- Habit Tracker: add/complete habits, difficulty suggestions, stats

Add screenshots under `docs/screenshots/` and update image paths above. Suggested files:
- `home.png`, `daily_hub.png`, `timeline.png`, `weekly_review.png`, `habit_tracker.png`

## Architecture
- UI: Flutter widgets with animations (`AnimationController`, transitions, haptics)
- State: local `setState` with structured services for data
- Data: Repository-style `StorageService` delegating to Mongo services
- DB: MongoDB Atlas via `mongo_dart`, collections for moods, todos, reviews, habits, goals
- Notifications: `flutter_local_notifications` with timezone scheduling

## Tech Stack
- Flutter 3.x
- mongo_dart
- flutter_local_notifications
- permission_handler
- fl_chart

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed (run `flutter doctor`)
- Android SDK / emulator
- MongoDB Atlas cluster and connection string

### Setup
1) Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

2) Configure MongoDB
- Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Whitelist your IP or set ‚ÄúAccess from Anywhere‚Äù
- Create database user and password
- Update your connection string in `lib/services/mongodb_service.dart` (database `bloom_app` recommended)

3) Android permissions
- Notifications are requested at runtime; for Android 13+, the app asks permission on init
- If you schedule daily reminders, the app uses inexact alarms to avoid exact-alarm permission

### Run
```bash
flutter run
```

## Notifications
- Ad-hoc test from Home AppBar bell icon
- Daily reminder: enable toggle and choose time on Home
- Implementation: `NotificationService` with timezone support and safe inexact scheduling

## Development Notes
- Animations tuned for responsiveness; use pull-to-refresh on major lists
- Timeline supports compact/expanded view and mood filters
- Quick Log uses a local `StatefulBuilder` for instant tapping
- Daily reminder uses inexact alarms to avoid exact-alarm permission issues

## Roadmap
- Optional: sticky headers for Timeline
- Search and advanced filters (by activity/trigger/date)
- Export data (CSV/JSON)
- iOS build and notification tuning
